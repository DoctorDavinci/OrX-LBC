OrX - The Loot Box Controversy


PLEASE BE ADVISED OF THE FOLLOWING: 

In order to use the OrX KIS items (OrX Helmets, OrX ParaMotor, OrX Scuba Tanks, OrX SM Small Arms weapons etc...) you must install KIS and it's dependancies 
https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/149848-14-kerbal-inventory-system-kis-v114/


Also, in order to use the BDAc addon features and parts (OrX Missions, OrX SM Small Arms weapons etc...) you must install BD Armory v1.2.2.2a and Physics Range Extender
https://github.com/PapaJoesSoup/BDArmory/releases/tag/v1.2.2.2a
https://github.com/jrodrigv/PhysicsRangeExtender/releases

DISCLAIMER: OrX has been developed and tested only within the confines of Kerbin and within Kerbin's atmosphere ... If you use OrX outside of Kerbins atmosphere OR use it with Kopernicus or any other mod that modify's the stock KSP planetary system, I am unsure as to what will happen and all bets are off - This means no support will be given for the above described circumstances at this time



--Feature List--

------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------
-- OrX Scuba Kerb System
------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------

The OrX Scuba Kerb system gives your kerbals the ability to explore the depths of the oceans 

There is no need for a Scuba Tank to go swimming but it's better if you take one (or two) with you since if you run out of oxygen your kerbal will go ragdoll (ragdoll Kerbals can be revived if brought back to the surface and if the atmosphere contains Oxygen)

When your kerbal is splashed and the active vessel, a menu will open giving you a trim up and a trim down button that you can use to control the ballast of your kerbal using your mouse

Balast can be controlled by hotkeys while your Kerbal is splashed and the Scuba Kerb menu is open ... Q to trim up, E to trim down, Left Shift to reset ballast to 0 and Left Ctrl to add 10x your Kerbals mass to emergency dive (HOTKEYS ARE EXPERIMENTAL)

The Oxygen slider displays your Kerbals total Oxygen amount and also accounts for having an OrX Scuba Tank equipped by adding the contents of the tank to the total amount ... When you equip a tank your Kerbal Oxygen level will be immediately replenished to max as well as Oxygen will be taken from the tanks before being taken from the Kerbal while under water

The modifier slider in the menu is for making minor adjustments to how much ballast is added or subtracted from your kerbal when trimming up or down ... click on the slider to adjust the ballast amount

If you are at the surface of the ocean or on land your Oxygen will replenish if in an atmosphere that contains Oxygen

PLEASE NOTE: Yes, this system can very likely be used for purposes other than Scuba Diving ... This will be explored in the future



------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------
--OrX HoloCache System--
------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------

The OrX HoloCache System brings GeoCaching to KSP ... Now players can go to a location and create a 'HoloCache' that will allow a user to name the location, provide 3 lines of text to describe the location, record the gps location of the HoloCache (as well as up to 10 vessels within a 2km radius) then save that info to a config file ... Any crafts that have a GPS location stored in the HoloCache are also saved as craft files for later spawning

The the config and craft files created are saved to GameData/OrXHoloCache/'Users HoloCache Name' ... Players can share the directories inside of the GameData/OrXHoloCache directory with other players and the coordinates will be available to be loaded into the HoloCache control menu in the flight scene if they have OrX installed (copy shared HoloCache directories to GameData/OrXHoloCache)

To load a HoloCache ... Open the HoloCache Control menu (green OrX with angled yellow script button) then click on 'Reload HoloCache Data' and any Holocache directory contained within GameData/OrXHoloCache will be added to the list in the menu ... Click on a HoloCache in the list to have a red dot drawn on the world telling you where that location is visually

To creat a HoloCache ... Go to the location you want to create the HoloCache and open the HoloCache Control menu, then click on 'Spawn Empty HoloCache' and a HoloCache will spawn after which a menu will pop up allowing you to name your HoloCache and provide 3 lines of text to describe the location ... PLEASE NOTE: HoloCache names must have no spaces or special characters in them (only letters and numbers, nothing else or the HoloCache System will get cranky)

Click on the 'SAVE VESSELS' button to tell the HoloCache to save any vessels that are within a 2 km radius of the (maximum of 10 vessels can be saved)

Click on the 'Save HoloCache' button to save the HoloCache 

When you select a HoloCache location in the HoloCache Control menu, the system will check your distance from that point and if you are within the physics load range of your KSP save then the HoloCache will be spawned (Maximum HoloCache spawn range capped at 15km due to reasons)

HoloCaches and the vessels they spawn are spawned in an unknown status ... Once the HoloCache spawns, a menu will show up with the description entered at the time that the HoloCache was saved and then the HoloCache part will start to spawn any vessels that were saved when the HoloCache was made if the 'SAVE VESSELS' feature was used

If using the HoloCache System with BD Armory Continued, vessels will spawn with weapon managers and AI active as well as on the opposite team (EXPERIMENTAL)



------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------
-- ADDITIONAL FEATURES IF BD ARMORY CONTINUED IS INSTALLED --
------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------

OrX Missions (Loot Box Controversy, Waldo's Island etc...) as well as a survival mode (Iron Kerbal) 

Enemy spawning system ... Spawns vessels on opposite team with AI and Guard mode active (Ground and Air vessels)

Enemy Kerbal (OrX) spawning ... some of them are spawned fully armed with KIS weapons and shoot at you (Enemy OrX will chase you ... they also will swim after you if you're in the water)

Enemy Kerbals will dive after you and will go ragdoll if they run out of Oxygen so you can get away if you have some extra air if doing a frogman (unless you're being chased by Scuba OrX)

Sporting Goods Department for spending the Salt you earn from killing enemies ... buy Kerbal upgrades to make you run faster, swim faster, strafe faster, walk faster and jump higher or buy prebuilt vessels or loot box supply drops to your location etc...

Loot Boxes to rearm yourself with while on a mission (free of charge at the end of each level and can be purchased with Salt from the Sporting Goods Department)

10 enemy spawn points per mission (Iron Kerbal is random spawning location based off active vessel)

------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------

OrX comes in two parts .... the base install and the OrX BDAc addon

In the release download (.zip file from the OrX releases section on GitHub) you will find a GameData directory and a BDAcGameData directory ... each contains an OrX directory (GameData/OrX and BDAcGameData/OrX repectively)

Copy the GameData/OrX directory and it's contents to your KSP's GameData directory for the base OrX install (Required) ... Scuba Kerb, OrX ParaMotor and the HoloCache System are contained within this this part of OrX

If you wish to use BD Armory Continued with OrX and utilize the missions and other features, copy the BDAcGameData/OrX directory and it's contents to your KSP's GameData directory (base OrX install required) ... This adds the weapons, missions and some other goodies to the base OrX install

Both parts of the mod should be installed as 'your KSP directory'/GameData/OrX

PLEASE NOTE: There are two custom editor categories that come with OrX ... The OrX parts category contains parts from the base install of OrX and the OrXSMSA parts category contains the OrX SM Small Arms parts such as guns and ammo etc... (only is visible if the OrX BDAc addon is installed)

If you have installed the OrX BDAc addon and wish to remove it, delete the GameData/OrX/Plugin/OrXBDAC.dll file and the GameData/OrX/Parts/@Weapons directory and all of it's contents (yes, there is an @ symbol in the weapon parts directory name in order to make it easier to find and remove by users)
