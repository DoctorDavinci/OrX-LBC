	description = Following the terror that followed the arrival of the SecuBots around KSC efforts were made to make them less intimidating the result of all the hammering and grinding was this The MicroBot16S . No longer a towering colosuss these littel fellas have been widely accepted and it's not unusual to see them covered in ribald graffiti .  This mini version is no less a deterrent it's diminutive size leads it to be overlooked and disregarded by intruders, it does still possess a 16 barrel 10x25mm rotary cannon and the locking and scanning features of it's larger siblings
