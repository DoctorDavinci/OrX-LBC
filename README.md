It includs a survival game mode (Iron Kerbal) that has random enemy spawning, 4 different sizes of enemy Kerbals, Loot Boxes to replenish your supplies, additional KIS weapons, Scuba Diving, OrX ParaMotor and a mission selector (Under Development) as well as numerous easter eggs

OrX also contains a Sporting Goods Department where you can purchase supply drops, JDAM strikes, vessels, power-ups (hp increses, medpacks, run/walk/strafe speed boost) among other things with Salt the player earns through either converting mined Ore into Salt via the EULA Refinery (Extremely Useless Legal Agregate) or defeating OrX enemies (Under Development)
